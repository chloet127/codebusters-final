# World Happiness
## Codebusters Final Project

This project aims to to analyze how *happiness* is affected by other facets of life throughout the world.  We will specifically be looking at *social support* and *life expectancy* while comparing those variables to happiness levels for a given country.  Our data originates from the __World Happiness Report__ survey conducted by the *United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network*.
